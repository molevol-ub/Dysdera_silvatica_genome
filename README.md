# Introduction

This is a small git repository of the scripts we used in the genome assembly, annotation and comparative analysis of the _Dysdera silvatica_ genome project, the inital draft assembly and the chromosome level assembly.

We also add information regarding additional supporting data provided within the original journal publication and some concerns about the data and how to manipulate it. We include several scripts in perl, python or R that might need additional requeriments that we have not included here.
